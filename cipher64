Base64 AES-encrypted Values
Several base64-encoded values were identified as AES-encrypted ciphertexts. In each case, the salt was recovered directly from the network traffic in the controller message:
“Affirmative. Yes. Salty 241fa86763b85341”
This salt was reused across multiple encrypted values.

Ciphertext:
MYzJQjYmKdJkBxEe87tDowzbefGKZCYM1VmmRfLf2A4=
Decrypted value: APPLECORE
Password: Munich
This value required identification of both the salt and the password. OpenSSL was used to attempt decryption, and a Python script was written to iterate through a German cities’ wordlist using lowercase, uppercase and sentence case variations. A successful match was found for “Munich”.
The full command and script will be added later.

Ciphertext:
xVPDRdUtzsjxlYaJQUOSYQ==
Decrypted value: [Placeholder]
Password: WIESBADEN
The same salt and approach were used as above. The password “Wiesbaden” was identified from the German cities wordlist. Final decrypted output will be added later.

Ciphertext:
H572uA9ebJKbbjjOPobKYw==
Decrypted value: [Placeholder]
Password: [Placeholder]
This ciphertext was processed using the same AES decryption approach. Although the salt was successfully identified, the correct password has not yet been confirmed. Further wordlist testing is required.
